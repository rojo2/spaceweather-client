**DEPRECATED**: see https://github.com/rojo2/icarus-client for a new versión using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)

## How to install

First of all you need to install NVM, if you already have it, just run `nvm install && nvm use` where the `.nvmrc` is.

To install NVM (with CURL):

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.29.0/install.sh | bash
```

To install NVM (with wget):

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.29.0/install.sh | bash
```

Now that you have NVM, run `nvm install && nvm use`.

When you have verified that you are running the correct Node.js version then you can run NPM to install dependencies.

```
npm install # Install dependencies
npm start   # Run project
```

## How to test it

```
npm test    # Run test
```
